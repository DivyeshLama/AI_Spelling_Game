# AI_Spelling_Game
AI Spelling Game for Children
This project is an early-stage AI-powered spelling game aimed at helping young children, particularly those with dyslexia, practice and improve their spelling skills in an engaging and supportive environment. The current version offers basic functionality, including spelling challenges, user selection, score tracking, and simple visual and sound effects to make the experience more interactive and fun for kids.
At this stage, the app is in its initial development phase, and many features are still being planned and built. Future updates will include more advanced AI-driven adaptations based on the child's progress, improved UI design, richer animations, and detailed learning reports to better support different learning styles.
This project is a work in progress and will continue to evolve over time with regular improvements and feature additions.
